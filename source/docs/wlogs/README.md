# Introduction

## What?

Windows Event Logs and the tools to query them.

## Why?

To understand the activity of the system, diagnose problems, and to combine log file entries from multiple sources with 
statistical analysis, to yield correlations between seemingly unrelated events on different servers.

## How?

* [Event logs](events.md)
* [XPath queries](xpath.md)
* [Event IDs](ids.md)
* [Scenarios](scenarios.md)
