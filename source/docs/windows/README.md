# Introduction

## What?

A security system for Windows that detects, investigates, and mitigates threats like ransomware, credential theft, 
and LOLBins (Living-Off-the-Land Binaries). It combines Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Attack Surface Reduction 
(ASR) rules, and behavioral analytics to stop advanced attacks.

## Why?

* #1 targeted OS: 90% of malware attacks focus on Windows.
* Native tools arenâ€™t enough: Defender misses fileless attacks and LOLBins.
* Regulatory demands: Needed for HIPAA, GDPR, and FedRAMP compliance.
